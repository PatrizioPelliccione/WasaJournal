\must{Provide the name for the viewpoint.}

If there are any synonyms or other common names by which this viewpoint is
known or used, record them here.

\subsection{Overview} 
%%%%%%%%%%
Connected cars will benefit from Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Smart Cities and IoT to provide new application scenarios like smart traffic control,  smart platooning coordination, collective collision avoidance, etc. 
Vehicles will combine data collected through its sensors %from the inside vehicle 
with external data coming from the environment, e.g. other vehicles, road, cloud, etc. %In such scenario, different applications will be possible: smart traffic control, better platooning coordination and enhanced safety in general. 
%While solving congestion is undoubtedly beneficial, safety remains the top priority for OEMs.

%In connected vehicles, safety aspects become more complex. 
Connected vehicles will face new challenges and opportunities related to safety issues.
%On the one hand, c
Current %While there are clear 
regulations for safety aspects, like the ISO 26262 standard, do not account for scenarios in which the %provide a clear regulation for  
% regarding isolated car system (seat belts, airbags etc..) like in the safety standard ISO 26262, there is a lack of 
%safety requirements for 
%systems of connected cars. The 
vehicle is part of a more complex system; the challenge is on how to manage new hazards that coming from the environment could jeopardize safety. 
%The core ECUs of the car (in charge of braking, steering, engine control, etc.) are part of a closed system in which all the safety requirements can be certified at design time. Exposing these crucial components to the outside environment would invalidates the assumptions that have been made so far. In fact, manufactures have preferred to limit the interfaces of the communication infrastructure due to the enormous hazard potential. In a connected world,  this is no longer possible. Sharing and controlling sensitive information could be crucial in dangerous situations. 
%On the other hand, c
At the same time, connected cars open new opportunities for safety, called ``connected safety" within Volvo Cars\footnote{\url{https://goo.gl/mIWWS3}}: %({\small \url{https://goo.gl/mIWWS3}}):
e.g., this new technology will allow a connected car to be aware of a slippery road, of cyclists on the road, etc., so to initiate all the actions needed to avoid accidents and collisions. 
%
%after it has been informed by another car and the information has been propagated via the Volvo Cloud. In such scenario, the informed car could automatically slow down reducing the risk for potential accidents. 

These scenarios are posing new requirements to the architecture. %To deal with similar scenarios, changes need to be made in the architecture. 
We foreseen two different viewpoints and views: (i) %one viewpoint and view showing the architecture 
from the point of view of a single connected car, which has to offer the functionalities needed to realize the scenario, and (ii) %another viewpoint and view representing the 
from the point of view of the system of systems  (i.e. cars connected with other entities of their environment), spanning from the agreements between the different systems affected, e.g. different OEMs, cloud providers, road infrastructures, etc., to the definition of the scenario that the system of systems has to realize, like the slippery road mentioned above. 

% agreements between the different systems affected. In order to achieve the proper behavior of such system different stakeholders must be involved. From tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers to the cloud provider, they all have to agree on common interfaces and safety guarantees that must be respected.

%Until lately, safety has been dedicated in surviving crashes, with the emerging connected vehicle it will be about avoiding them. For example, the new technologies developed by Volvo allow a connected car to be aware of a slippery road after it has been informed by another car and the information has been propagated via the Volvo Cloud. In such scenario, the informed car could automatically slow down reducing the risk for potential accidents.

%To accomplish similar scenarios, radical changes need to be made in the architecture descriptions and agreements between the different systems affected. In order to achieve the proper behavior of such system different stakeholders must be involved. From tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers to the cloud provider, they all have to agree on common interfaces and safety guarantees that must be respected.

%<<<<<<< HEAD
In general, the main issue with safety guarantees in connected cars is that a full analysis of the system is not possible at design time. When moving from a single vehicle to a cooperative system, a new safety analysis is required to handle uncertainties at runtime. Some approaches have been proposed to deal with certification at runtime, e.g.~\cite{runtime1, runtime3}, but a clear framework that can be used to define the connected safety requirements is still missing.

When moving from a single vehicle to a cooperative system, a new safety analysis is required to handle the uncertainties at runtime. Therefore, in order to benefit from the collaborative system, is necessary to move some of the safety analysis from design time to runtime. Some approaches have been proposed to deals with certification of the safety guarantees at runtime \cite{runtime1}, \cite{runtime2}, \cite{runtime3}, but there is still not a clear framework utilized to define the connected safety requirements.

\subsection{Concerns and stakeholders} 
%%%%%%%%%%

Architects looking for an architecture viewpoint suitable for their
purposes often use the identified concerns and typical stakeholders to
guide them in their search.  Therefore it is important (and required
by the Standard) to document the concerns and stakeholders for which a
viewpoint is intended.

%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Concerns}\label{vp:concerns}
%%%%%%%%%%

\must{Provide a listing of architecture-relevant concerns to be framed by
this architecture viewpoint per \std{7a}.}

Describe each concern.

Concerns name ``areas of interest'' in a system.

\note{Following ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, \textbf{system} is a shorthand for
  any number of things including man-made systems, software products
  and services, and software-intensive systems such as ``individual
  applications, systems in the traditional sense, subsystems, systems
  of systems, product lines, product families, whole enterprises, and
  other aggregations of interest''.}

Concerns may be very general (e.g., \textit{Reliability}) or quite
specific (\textit{e.g., How does the system handle network latency?}).
  
Concerns identified in this section are critical information for an
architect because they help her decide when this viewpoint will be
useful.

When used in an architecture description, the viewpoint becomes a
``contract'' between the architect and stakeholders that these
concerns will be addressed in the view resulting from this viewpoint.

It can be helpful to express concerns \emph{in the form of questions}
that views resulting from that viewpoint will be able to answer. E.g.,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{How does the system manage faults?}
\item \textit{What services does the system provide?}
\end{itemize}

\note{``In the form of a question'' is inspired by the television quiz
  show, \textit{Jeopardy!}}
 
\std{5.3} contains a candidate list of concerns that must be considered
when producing an architecture description. These can be considered
here for their relevance to the viewpoint being specified:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the purpose(s) of the system-of-interest?
\item What is the suitability of the architecture for achieving the
  system-of-interest's purpose(s)?
\item How feasible is it to construct and deploy the
  system-of-interest?
\item What are the potential risks and impacts of the
  system-of-interest to its stakeholders throughout its life cycle?
\item How is the system-of-interest to be maintained and evolved?
\end{itemize}

See also: \std{4.2.3}.

%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Typical stakeholders} 
%%%%%%%%%%

\must{Provide a listing of the typical stakeholders of a system who
  are in the potential audience for views of this kind, per \std{7b}.}

Typical stakeholders would include those likely to read such views
and/or those who need to use the results of this view for another
task.

Stakeholders to consider include:
\begin{itemize}
\item users of a system; 
\item operators of a system; 
\item acquirers of a system;
\item owners of a system; 
\item suppliers of a system; 
\item developers of a system; 
\item builders of a system; 
\item maintainers of a system.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{``Anti-concerns'' \Optional} 
%%%%%%%%%%

It may be helpful to architects and stakeholders to
document the kinds of issues for which this viewpoint is \emph{not
  appropriate or not particularly useful}.

Identifying the ``anti-concerns'' of a given notation or approach may
be a good antidote for certain overly used models and notations.

% \tbd{Examples!}



%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Model kinds+}\label{mk:list}
%%%%%%%%%%

\must{Identify each model kind used in the viewpoint per \std{7c}.}

In the Standard, each architecture view consists of multiple
architecture models. Each model is governed by a \textit{model kind}
which establishes the notations, conventions and rules for models of
that type.  See: \std{4.2.5, 5.5 and 5.6}.

Repeat the next section for each model kind listed here the viewpoint
being specified.


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\Fillin{Model Kind Name}}\label{vp:mk}
%%%%%%%%%%

\must{Identify the model kind.}


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\Fillin{Model Kind Name} conventions} 
%%%%%%%%%%

\must{Describe the conventions for models of this kind.}

Conventions include languages, notations, modeling techniques,
analytical methods and other operations. These are key modeling
resources that the model kind makes available to architects and
determine the vocabularies for constructing models of the kind and
therefore, how those models are interpreted and used.

It can be useful to separate these conventions into a \emph{language
  part}: in terms of a metamodel or specification of notation to be
used and a \emph{process part}: to describe modeling techniques used
to create the models and methods which can be used on the models that
result.  These include operations on models of the model kind.

The remainder of this section focuses on the language part. The next
section focuses on the process part.

The Standard does not prescribe \emph{how} modeling conventions are to
be documented.  The conventions could be defined:
\begin{description}
\item[I)] by reference to an existing notation or language (such as
  SADT, UML or an architecture description language such as ArchiMate
  or SysML) or to an existing technique (such as $M/M/4$ queues);
\item[II)] by presenting a metamodel defining its core constructs;
\item[III)] via a template for users to fill in;
\item[IV)] by some combination of these methods or in some other
  manner.
\end{description}

Further guidance on methods I) through III) is provided below.
 
Sometimes conventions are applicable across more than one model kind
-- it is not necessary to provide a separate set of conventions, a
metamodel, notations, or operations for each, when a single
specification is adequate.


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{I) Model kind languages or notations \Optional}
%%%%%%%%%%

Identify or define the notation used in models of the kind.

Identify an existing notation or model language or define one that can
be used for models of this model kind. Describe its syntax, semantics,
tool support, as needed.


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{II) Model kind metamodel \Optional} 
%%%%%%%%%%

A metamodel presents the AD elements that constitute the
vocabulary of a model kind, and their rules of combination. There are
different ways of representing metamodels (such as UML class diagrams, OWL,
eCore). The metamodel should present:
\begin{description}
\item[entities] What are the major sorts of conceptual elements that
  are present in models of this kind?
\item[attributes] What properties do entities possess in models of
  this kind?
\item[relationships] What relations are defined among entities in
  models of this kind?
\item[constraints] What constraints are there on entities, attributes
  and/or relationships and their combinations in models of this kind?
\end{description}

\note{Metamodel constraints should not be confused with architecture
  constraints that apply to the subject being modeled, not the
  notations used.}

In the terms of the Standard, entities, attributes, relationships are
\textit{AD elements} per \std{3.4, 4.2.5 and 5.7}.

In the \textit{Views-and-Beyond} approach~\cite{DSA:2010}, each
viewtype (which is similar to a viewpoint) is specified by a set of
elements, properties, and relations (which correspond to entities,
attributes and relationships here, respectively).

When a viewpoint specifies multiple model kinds it can be useful to
specify a single viewpoint metamodel unifying the definition of the
model kinds and the expression of correspondence rules.  When defining
an architecture framework, it may be helpful to use a single metamodel
to express multiple, related viewpoints and model kinds.

% \tbd{EXAMPLE -- In \cite{Hilliard:1999} and earlier work, we said that
%   all views are built from primitives called components, connections
%   and constraints which basically gives views a graph structure with
%   components as nodes and two types of edges (connections and
%   constraints). There are two issues with this: (\textit{1})
%   components and \textit{connectors} have taken on a specialized
%   meaning from the work by CMU and others \cite{Shaw-Garlan:1996};
%   (\textit{2}) this ur-ontology may be over-commiting for some views.}


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{III) Model kind templates \Optional}
%%%%%%%%%%

Provide a template or form specifying the format and/or content of
models of this model kind.

%% \tbd{EXAMPLE} 


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\Fillin{Model Kind Name} operations \Optional} 
%%%%%%%%%%

Specify operations defined on models of this kind.

See~\S\ref{Opns} for further guidance.


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\Fillin{Model Kind Name} correspondence rules}
%%%%%%%%%%

\must{Document any correspondence rules associated with the model
  kind.}

See~\S\ref{CRs} for further guidance.


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Operations on views}\label{Opns}
%%%%%%%%%%

Operations define the methods to be applied to views and their models.
Types of operations include:

\begin{description}

\item[construction methods] are the means by which views are
  constructed under this viewpoint. These operations could be in the
  form of process guidance (how to start, what to do next); or work
  product guidance (templates for views of this type). Construction
  techniques may also be heuristic: identifying styles, patterns, or
  other idioms to apply in the synthesis of the view.

\item[interpretation methods] which guide readers to understanding
  and interpreting architecture views and their models.

\item[analysis methods] are used to check, reason about, transform,
  predict, and evaluate architectural results from this view,
  including operations which refer to model correspondence rules.

\item[implementation methods] are the means by which to design and
  build systems using this view.

\end{description}

Another approach to categorizing operations is from Finkelstein et
al. \cite{Finkelstein+1992}. The \emph{work plan} for a viewpoint
defines 4 kinds of actions (on the view representations):
\textit{assembly actions} which contains the actions available to the
developer to build a specification; \textit{check actions} which
contains the actions available to the developer to check the
consistency of the specification; \textit{viewpoint actions} which
create new viewpoints as development proceeds; \textit{guide actions}
which provide the developer with guidance on what to do and when.


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Correspondence rules}\label{CRs}
%%%%%%%%%%

\must{Document any correspondence rules defined by this viewpoint or
  its model kinds.}

Usually, these rules will be across models or across views since,
constraints within a model kind will have been specified as part of
the conventions of that model kind.

See: \std{4.2.6 and 5.7}

need or find helpful.
