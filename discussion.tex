\section{Discussion and Concluding remarks}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we described the current evaluation of Volvo Cars towards the definition of an architecture framework.
In this stage we are identifying potential viewpoints of the vehicles of the near future. We will then identify the modeling languages to be used to describe the architecture. According to the actual needs and to the consumers of the particular view, we will identify the modeling language to be used and we will find the right tradeoff between a language
(i) able to support the level of formality and precision required by disciplined development processes, or
(ii) simple and intuitive enough to communicate the right message to stakeholders and to promote collaboration~\cite{whatindustrywants,IEEESoftwarePatrizio}.

For what concerns the realization of the architecture framework we will investigate MEGAF~\cite{MEGAF2010,MEGAF2012}, 
%
%MEGAF has been conceived with the aim of overcoming limitations of existing architecture frameworks. Most of the architecture framework in use are
%closed (i.e. they cannot be easily extended or adapted to new needs),
%%and the construction of existing ones requires a complete rework since reuse is not supported at all.
%and tool support for architecture frameworks exhibits this limitation
%as well: automated support, where it exists, follows the predefined
%viewpoints and models; support for developing extensions of
%architecture frameworks in terms of new viewpoints is non-existent.
%
%MEGAF is 
which is an infrastructure that enables software architects to realize their
own architecture frameworks specialized for a particular
application domain or community of stakeholders and compliant to the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard~\cite{42010}. 
%It offers
%an effective way of managing, storing, retrieving, and combining
%existing viewpoints, by properly selecting and reusing
%models previously defined and resident in MEGAF. 
%Architecture
%frameworks that can be realized by using MEGAF
%conform to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010~\cite{42010}. 
%Once an architecture
%framework has been defined within MEGAF, it can be used
%to create architecture descriptions of systems-of-interest.
%%Architecture descriptions are easily made to adhere to the
%%architecture framework used to realize them. For instance,
%%the realized architecture models adhere to the conventions of
%%their model kinds as defined by the architecture framework
%%and its viewpoints.
%Moreover, the MEGAF infrastructure enables the architect
%to express and enforce relations both between various
%elements within an architecture description and across architecture
%descriptions. %Further details about MEGAF\footnote{\url{http://megaf.di.univaq.it/}} might be found at~\cite{MEGAF2010,MEGAF2012}.
