	abstract = {Context: Hutchinson et al. conducted an interview-based study of how model-driven engineering, {MDE}, is practiced in 17 companies. Their results include that successful {MDE} companies develop domain-specific languages; are motivated by a clear business case; and are committed at all levels of the organization. Goal: Whilst the results are useful, the study is a very broad one, with one or two interviewees per company. This paper supplements Hutchinson's study by focusing on three large companies that are applying {MDE} and undergoing a parallel transition to agile methods. Method: Formal data collection strategies -- 25 semi-structured interviews, observations and progress meetings -- were combined with informal interaction. The data was analysed both inductively for new insights and deductively for comparison with the results of Hutchinson et al. Results: Our findings show how {MDE} can include domain experts in software development and how agile development and {MDE} can coexist. In general our results validate the findings of Hutchinson et al. There are two areas where our results differ -- the engineers' sense of control and the appropriateness of their skills and training. Conclusions: Using a combination of data collection strategies and analysis techniques our study casts new light on earlier research as well as contributes with novel insights regarding the adoption of {MDE}.},

  abstract = {Automotive engineering is characterized by relying heavily on complex
	supplier networks as well as by strong dependence from hardware and
	software component development. OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)
	coordinate and integrate the work of hardware and software component
	suppliers and to an increasing amount develop application software
	themselves (component suppliers can be internal). For OEMs the transition
	to model-driven development promises potential reduction in the development
	lead-time of complex in-vehicle automotive features, such as semi-autonomous
	driving, but it is not without challenges. For example, the verification
	of such features is still performed using mainly physical properties
	such as hardware benches and mule vehicles. While this step is necessary,
	it is not sufficient, because it does not allow early verification
	of design decisions to the required extent. In addition, the development
	speed of hardware and software components is (a) limited by hardware
	development cycles as well as (b) slowed down by unsynchronized software
	development cycles of key suppliers. This prevents detailed information
	from being available early and potentially resulting in expensive
	and late changes. Understanding this situation as an ecosystem of
	cross-organizational collaborations allows us to reason about challenges
	and opportunities of the interaction between the OEM and different
	component- as well as tool-providers. In this paper, we report first
	results from an exploratory study that involved interviews with one
	of our industrial partners, General Motors (GM). First, we describe
	our understanding of the automotive ecosystem. Second, we explore
	interactions and roles of different ecosystem actors based on workshops
	and interviews with engineers at GM.},
